# MySQL

- 	mysql.com/downloads (community download)
		* mysql server, dmg


### 	Configurations - you have to do: 

		- Add MySQL to path (inside .bash_profile if you don't already have one)
		  which mysql, which php or find the path

			> ex: export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" or add on to an existing path

		- Text editor (I have sublime setup by default instead of nano) cli and alias configured 
		  to open it via terminal either with 'subl' or 'sublime'

		- Other modifications: 

			- clear command replaced with just 'c' faster (actually either one)
			- terminal prompt: added a separator line to clearly indicate the end
			  of a command execution
			- apachectl start replaced with apacheRestart and many others 
			  (see .bash_profile)
